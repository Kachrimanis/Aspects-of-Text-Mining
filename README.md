# Aspects-of-Text-Mining
This project is aimed to implement the basic algorithms of text mining including the bag-of-words model. The main goal is to combine the usage of this particular technique with NLTK aiming to surpass orthographical mistakes in order to achieve even better text recognition. The implementation has been made using Python.
